# Too good not to be notified
Customizable notification service for [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.fr/) (TGTG) application.
___

If you have ever used the TGTG application, you have probably had, like me, a great deal of frustration. The frustration of not being able to set up notifications on this application. You can only open the application compulsively at the times when baskets are usually available, otherwise you are condemned to systematically go last, and nothing is available anymore.

## Features

### Get notified instantly when a basket is available

When a basket is available in your area, you receive an instant SMS notification. **No delay**.

### Configure a cooldown so you don't get spammed

Fully configurable cooldowns that ensure you don't get spammed with notifications :
- A first high-level cooldown that blocks all notifications for X hours once notified
- A much more precise cooldown configured by store, which ensures some variety in notifications. You then can't get notified for a store that already notified you for X hours.

### Be notified only at the times of day you choose

You can enter the specific times of the day you wish to be notified. You will **never** be notified outside of these ranges. This ensures that you are not notified at critical times such as at night or during your working hours for example.
